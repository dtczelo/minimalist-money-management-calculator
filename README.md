# Minimalist money management calculator
 
Minimalist utility for index(DAX40, CAC40, etc..) position calculation with [bunjs](https://bun.sh)



## Background

Bun is the lastest and arguably the fastest runtime environment for javascript, similar to node and deno. Bun uses JSC (JavaScriptCore) engine unlike node and 
deno which is the part of the reason why it's faster than node and deno.

Bun is written in a low-level manual memory management programming language called [ZIG](https://ziglang.org).

Bun supports ~90% of the native nodejs APIs including `fs`, `path` etc. and also distribute it's packages using [npm](https://npmjs.com) hence both `yarn` and `npm` are supported in bun.

## DevNote:
Although this version is actively still under development so also is [bunjs](https://bun.sh) and might contain some bugs, hence, not ideal for a production app.
